  <p>EyeSee is an open-source assistive communication tool developed for individuals living with paralysis or Locked-In Syndrome (LIS).</p>
  <p>LIS is a medical condition in which a patient is conscious but unable to communicate verbally due to complete bodily paralysis.

    <h3>Blink is an open-source assistive communication tool developed for individuals living with paralysis or Locked-In Syndrome (LIS).</h3>
    <h3>The project was started at Fullstack Code Academy as a capstone project. You can watch the presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYmM4S7ecr4">HERE</a></h3>
    <p>LIS is a medical condition in which a patient is conscious but unable to communicate verbally due to complete bodily paralysis. However, many individuals retain the ability to perform eye movements, which is enough to enable vital communication - with proper outlets for expression, survival rates can increase to 80%.</p>

    <p>Our primary design goal was to transform complex computer vision into a simple, self-configuring communication app navigable solely with eye blinks and able to run on low-resolution webcams.</p>
    <h3>Key features include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Customizable eye, pupil, brow and mouth tracking to give a range of interactive options depending on the severity of paralysis</li>
        <li>Automatic calibration to personalize responsiveness to each user's unique range of motion and abilities</li>
        <li>Multiple keyboard types and layouts to accommodate personal preferences and communication styles</li>
        <li>Autocomplete and next-word prediction capacities which learn over time</li>
        <li>Basic real-time chat to connect users with each other</li>
    </ul>
